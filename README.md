# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis:
### The purpose of the new analysis is create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type and summarize how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decison-makers at PyBer.
## Results:
### From summary DataFrame, we can see Urban has highest total rides and total drivers, it's obviously to see Urban also has highest total fares. Suburban is the second highest and Rural is the third. But if we compare total rides and total drivers in Rural and Suburban with Urban, we find that drivers are fewer than rides, Urban has more drivers than rides which lead average fare per ride and average fare per driver are less than Rural and Suburban, one reason I can guess is Urban's capacity has reached its limit, it's not that easy to compete in this area and have high cost to investment.

From the line chart, we can see they all have very similar trends before April, but Suburban has uptrend after April compare the others, one reason I can imagine is suburban is not that crowded compare urban area and vacations are popular during the summer, people like go outside but still not too far from urban, suburban becomes the top choice.
